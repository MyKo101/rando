## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version, I have:

* Fixed a minor bug in the `tibble_n()` function

* Added more information to the Description field in the DESCRIPTION file

* Added more details to the `default_n()` function Details section

* Added \value tags for every .Rd file

* Adjusted the definition of `match.call2()` to better match what it does

* The code within the `\dontrun{}` tags cause errors when run
